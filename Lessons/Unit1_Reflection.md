#UNIT 1 REFLECTION
##What worked well during Unit1?

The main thing that worked well for was the way that we progressed in out ability to code in such a matter that was well strucuted and orderly. 
It allowed for my programmer skills and probleming solving abilities to greater improve this time spam.

##What did not work well?

One of the main things that didn't work well during the unit was when you needed help for a specific problem whether difficult or hard. Often times I would sit ont an
issue for several days at a time no knowing what to do. This was greatly reduced as I got to work and learn form my peers and other people I know to help me progress 
which helped. However there are still times where I am clueless on a problem and can't seem to solve it.

##What did you enjoy the most during project unit 1?

The enjoyed the problem solving aspect of programmer and the ability to make some code that works and does something useful. It provides a sense of accomplishment 
as you are able to move forward in your abilities and knowledge

##What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit ?

I think one of my main talents was my ability to understand was was going on in a problem or code relativly quicikly. However this often times only helped me slightly
as my coding knowledge slowed me down. Most of the time I knew what to do but wasn't aware specificly how to code it for it to work. 

##What is working well in Computer Science for you?

One of the main things that is working well for me is when trying to learn material outside of class. From the knowledge I gained in class it is much easier to understand
and learn stuff outside of class. Whether that be by watching videos or reading other code. This allows me to get differant perspectives and expand my knowledge.

##What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?

If there were specific times for us to independently meet Dr Ruben either inside or outside of class for a period of time for our personaly questions and concerns it would
greatly improve the experiance in Computer Science
